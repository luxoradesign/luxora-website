      <h1>About Luxora Design House Ltd.</h1>
      <p>Founded in 2025 by Acacia Mahon and Shawn Mahon, Luxora Design House Ltd. is more than a brand - it's a lifestyle. Every space we touch is crafted not just with luxury in mind, but with intention, story, and emotional resonance.</p>

      <p>What began as a vision to blend architectural mastery with soul-level healing has become a full-scale design empire. We build homes that protect, empower, and inspire — built for beauty, and born from purpose.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>To create intentional, empowering, and emotionally intelligent luxury design experiences that transform not just homes, but lives.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a world where design is not only beautiful but also bold, safe, and healing. Every room, every build, every finish — chosen with purpose.</p>

      <h2>Core Values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrity in every detail</li>
        <li>Luxury with emotional depth</li>
        <li>Innovation with timeless style</li>
        <li>Designing for empowerment and healing</li>
