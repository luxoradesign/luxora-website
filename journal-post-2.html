    <h1>The Moodboard Ritual</h1>
    <p class="intro"><em>Inside our creative process: color psychology, seasonal shifts, and the language of materials.</em></p>

    <p>Every project we take on begins with a ritual — the ritual of the moodboard. It’s not just cutting and pinning. It’s conjuring. It’s listening. It’s asking the space: *What do you want to say?* And more importantly: *How do you want to make them feel?*</p>

    <p>We don’t create based on trends. We create based on story, emotion, and embodiment. And a moodboard is where that story begins to breathe.</p>

    <h2>What goes into a Luxora moodboard?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Color palettes chosen not for trend, but for nervous system response</li>
      <li>Textures that say *safety* or *sophistication* before a word is spoken</li>
      <li>Lighting that mimics the time of day you feel most alive</li>
      <li>Symbols and style cues pulled from your memories, culture, and hopes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some days we build with linen and clay. Some days we build with softness and scent. Every board is built by hand, with heart. It’s a dialogue. It’s a vision board, but deeper. It’s the energetic spine of every project we bring to life.</p>

    <p>And when the client sees it — when their shoulders drop, or their breath slows — we know we’ve captured it. The feeling. The truth. The home they’ve been dreaming of, waiting to become real.</p>

    <p>That’s why we call it a ritual. Because beauty can be holy. And intention can be healing.</p>
